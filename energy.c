/* Knowing that 100 kW of energy cost 70% of the minimum wage, I wrote an algorithm that reads the value of the minimum wage and the amount of kW consumed by a residence. 
Calculate and print: 
the value in dollars of each kW; 
the value in dollars to be paid for the residenceâ€™s consumption; 
the new value to be paid by the residence with a 10% discount. */
